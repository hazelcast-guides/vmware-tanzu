:description: Install Hazelcast Enterprise in VMware Tanzu Application Service(TAS), create a cluster, and run a client.

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Install and configure the *Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise* tile in VMware Tanzu Application Service(TAS).
- Create a Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise cluster via service instances in TAS.
- Use a client application to add some data to a map in the Hazelcast cluster.

== Before you Begin

- https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/[cf cli]
- VMware Tanzu Application Service and Ops Manager environments
- Git
- JDK 1.8+
- Apache Maven 3.2+

== Step 1. Install and Configure Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for VMware Tanzu

Complete the following steps to download and install the Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for VMware Tanzu tile on Ops Manager.

. Download the product file from https://network.pivotal.io/products/hazelcast[VMware Tanzu Network].

. Go to your _Ops Manager_ dashboard at the pre-installed _VMware Tanzu Application Service_ environment.

. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click *Import a Product* to upload the product file.

. Click *Add* next to the uploaded Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for VMware Tanzu tile in the Ops Manager *Available Products* view to add it to your staging area.

. Click the newly added *Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for VMware Tanzu* tile.

. Click *Assign AZs and Networks*. In the *AZ and Network Assignments* pane, do the following:
.. Select the **Network** in which to deploy the Hazelcast Service Broker.
.. Select the **Service Network** in which to create VMs for Hazelcast.
.. Click **Save**.

. Click **First On-demand plan**. In the **Hazelcast on-demand plan** pane, do the following:
.. Enter a **Plan name**.
.. Enter a **Plan description**.
   For an example of how the plan name and description appear on the command line, see <<Using Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for VMware Tanzu,Step 1>> in the _Using Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for VMware Tanzu_ topic.

. Specify the number of **Hazelcast instances** for this plan. This property defines the number of Hazelcast instances to be created. It can be overridden for each service instance when creating a service instance by using `instanceCount` parameter. See <<Using Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for VMware Tanzu,Step 2>> in the _Using Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for VMware Tanzu_ topic for more information.

. Select a **Hazelcast VM type**. Choose a suitable VM type according to your data size and processing power requirements.

.  If you are planning on using features like https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#hot-restart-persistence[Hot Restart] that require a persistent disk, select a **Hazelcast Disk type**. Otherwise, you can leave this option empty because Hazelcast, by default, does not require a persistent disk.

. Select a **Management Center VM type**.

. If you are planning on migrating Management Center between service instances and deployments that require a persistent disk, select a **Management Center VM type**. Otherwise, you can leave this option empty because Management Center, by default, does not require a persistent disk.

. Select the **Hazelcast availability zone(s)** in which to create VMs for this plan.

. Click **Save**.

. If you want to modify the additional Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for VMware Tanzu plans, repeat the step above to configure the second and third on-demand plans.

. Click **Errands** and ensure that both **Register on-demand broker** and **Deregister on-demand broker** are selected. These are necessary to create and destroy Hazelcast service instances. You can disable **smoke-tests** errand to decrease installation time.

. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to complete the installation of Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for VMware Tanzu. Installation porcess takes 15 minutes approximately.

== Step 2. Use Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for VMware Tanzu

After your VMware Tanzu operator installs the Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for VMware Tanzu tile, it automatically registers itself to the Marketplace.

. Login with the CLI to _TAS_ environment:
[source,bash]
    $ cf login -a API-URL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -o ORG -s SPACE --skip-ssl-validation

. To check availability of Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for VMware Tanzu, run the following command:
[source,bash]
    $ cf marketplace
    Getting services from marketplace in org system / space system as admin...
    OK
    service         plans                            description
    hazelcast       small, medium, large    Hazelcast Service


. Clone the project to get JSON file containing service-specific configuration parameters:
[source,bash]
    $ git clone https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/vmware-tanzu.git

. To create a 3 nodes Hazelcast IMDG cluster and Management Center that coonnects to it, run the following command:
[source,bash]
    $ cf create-service hazelcast PLAN SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME -c /path/to/project/hazelcast-mancenter.json

    - Replace _PUT_LICENSE_KEY_HERE_ with the active Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise License or a trial license.

NOTE: You can create Hazelcast IMDG cluster without Management Center via following one line command as well <<Installing and Configuring Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for VMware Tanzu>>:
[source,bash]
    $ cf cs hazelcast PLAN SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME -c '{"hazelcast": {"license-key": "PUT_LICENSE_KEY_HERE"}}'


[start=5]
. After the services are created, you can build sample client application that utilizes `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable at project path:
[source,bash]
    $ mvn clean install

. To push application and , run following commands:
[source,bash]
    $ cf push APP_NAME -m 2G -i 1 -p /path/to/project/target/tanzu-sample-client-app-0.1.jar --no-manifest --no-start

. Now you can bind Hazelcast IMDG services to the application and start it:
[source,bash]
    $ cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME
    $ cf start APP_NAME

. To put/get data into Hazelcast IMDG map, run following commands:
[source,bash]
    $ export APP_ROUTE=`cf app APP_NAME | grep routes | awk '{ print $2 }'`
    $ curl -s "http://${APP_ROUTE}/put?key=1&value=1"
    $ curl -s "http://${APP_ROUTE}/get?key=1"

. You can reach Management Center dashboard via http://mancenter.YOUR_APPS_DOMAIN[] URL. Replace _YOUR_APPS_DOMAIN_ with the output of following command:
[source,bash]
    $ cf domains | grep -i apps.*.cf-app.com | awk '{ print $1 }'
